What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you git init the command creates a new .git file for your repository. Without a .git file you will not be able to make commits and will not be able to save versions of the files you've made changes to.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you put things from the working directory before you make a commit to the repository with the git add command line.
